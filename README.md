# CZ4042-SentimentAnalysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation and documentation for our final project on Sentiment Analysis using deep learning techniques. Three main areas of focus for the project are handling small datasets, comparing Transformer architectures, and domain adaptation.

## Files Included
1. environment.txt: Contains the list of Python packages and their versions, obtained from `pip freeze`
2. requirements.txt: Generated using `pipreqs`, this file lists the dependencies required for the project.
3. 4042-sentiment-analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing the code implementation. The notebook was trained on Kaggle
4. CX4042_Neural_Network_Report_v1.pdf: In PDF format, an extensive project report. It has an introduction, a summary of prior research, an explanation of the methodologies employed, an account of experiments and findings, and a discussion. The report follows the prescribed ten A4 page format.
